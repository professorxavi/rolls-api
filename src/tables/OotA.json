Its statistics are unchanged otherwise. Members are erudite and talkative, preferring diplomacy and debate over violence (though they defend themselves if attacked). Each society member can cast the teleport spell once per day, but the intended destination must be within 30 feet of another society member. This teleport effect can be disrupted (see “Faerzress” earlier in the chapter), which is how society members sometimes end up in far corners of the Underdark, separated from their fellows. Members of the Society of Brilliance are aware that paths to the surface world exist but haven’t explored any of them (their concerns are with the Underdark, after all). If the characters seem intent on reaching the surface, a society member might suggest they look for a guide in one of the Underdark’s larger settlements, such as Blingdenstone or Gracklstugh. The society member can provide detailed verbal directions that characters can follow to reach whichever Underdark settlement they desire.
